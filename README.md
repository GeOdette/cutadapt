# Remove adapter sequences, primers, poly-A tails and other types of unwanted sequence using cutadapt | [Pertinent information obtained from cutadapt original documentation](https://cutadapt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)


## About

Cutadapt helps with these trimming tasks by finding the adapter or primer sequences in an error-tolerant way. It can also modify and filter single-end and paired-end reads in various ways. Adapter sequences can contain IUPAC wildcard characters. Cutadapt can also demultiplex your reads.<br>
